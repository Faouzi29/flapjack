*** WELCOME TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD A FLAT RECORD PARSING ***
************************************************************

Flapjack is the PREMIER flat record parser....yea right.....
for all I know there is a better flat record parser out there.
This project has really materialized into a learning exercise
on how complicated flat record parsing really can be and how
I approached it.

To see how to use Flapjack please check:

Project site: http://code.google.com/p/flapjack

Usage Examples: there is a flap-jack example module that has
	different complexities of implementations.

Happy Parsing!  :0)
